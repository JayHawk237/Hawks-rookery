        <p>My name is Jamel Hawkins and I am father of two girls nicknamed Squidy and ChuChu.  
            During the Covid pandemic my entire deparment along with 7 other deparments were let go.
            <br>Like they say the only predictable thing is unpredictability.  So with my new found freedom I set out to improve myself by learning programming.
            <br> My goal is to use the skills learned during this course to find a job in the programming field or potentially work for myself. <br> I am very new to this, but I am motivated to make it work. I hope that as the course progresses I can also show my eldest daughter how to code to get her started young. <br>  </p>

            <p>My kids are my focal point and I love to watch them expolre their intrest and the world around them. I try to show them that even mundane things can be enjoyable if you are willing to think outside the box or just muddle though them.  I try to be the best role model for them that I can be.</p>

                <p> I am a huge anime fan. I mean like huge.  Out of my top ten all time movies at least four are anime films.  I try with varying degrees of success to pass this love of anime on to my daughter (who loves <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/ive-been-killing-slimes-for-300-years-and-maxed-out-my-level" style="color: purple;"> I've Been Killing Slimes for 300 Years and Maxed Out My Level</a>) and makes me watch her favorite show with her. <br>

                <h1>Cooking</h1>

                <p>Like all families we love to eat with each other and relax or play.  My wife and I take turns cooking and I am the sitting house cooking champion (which I am happy to flaunt).  I love to find new recipes (mainly BBQ) and often (with varying degrees of success) use them on my family to try them out.</p>
